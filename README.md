# Vue Musiccruncher
This is a side project that I created to learn Vue.js.
The homepage shows the name, Musiccruncher, while showing the top playlists on Spotify.
The search album button searches up a particular artist's top 20 playlist with album's release date and album cover showing.
In order to use this, you will need to run a Flask backend located here, [https://github.com/zbuchan/flask-musiccruncher].

## Project Setup
